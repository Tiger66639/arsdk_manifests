Samples which use this new API are available : [iOS Sample](https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/Samples/tree/master/iOS/SDKSample), [Android Sample](https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/Samples/tree/master/Android), [JSPilotingNewAPI](https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/Samples/tree/master/Unix/JSPilotingNewAPI) and [BebopPilotingNewAPI](https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/Samples/tree/master/Unix/BebopPilotingNewAPI) for Unix.\r\n\r\nIt's BSD license allows to use, change, distribute with no restriction.\r\nContributions and new feature discussions are highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n**The latest release version is tagged ARSDK3_version_3_10_1**. This version of the SDK is the one used in the latest versions of FreeFlight Pro and FreeFlight Mini. <br/>\r\nIt is fully compatible with the versions :\r\n\r\n* 3.3.0 and later for the Bebop drone\r\n* 3.9.0 and later for the Bebop 2\r\n* 1.0.11 and later for the Mambo\r\n* 1.0.8 and later for the Swing\r\n* 1.0.3 and later for the Disco\r\n* 1.99.2 for the Rolling Spider\r\n* 2.1.70 for the Airbornes\r\n* 1.99.0 for the Jumping Sumo\r\n* 2.1.53 for the Jumping Sumo Evos\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-------------\r\nPlease read [the install documentation](http://developer.parrot.com/docs/bebop/#go-deeper)\r\n\r\nQuestions\r\n----\r\n**If you have any questions, please open a new DroneSDK topic on the [Parrot Developer forum](http://forum.developer.parrot.com/).**\r\n\r\nSamples\r\n---------\r\nYou can find [samples files](https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3/Samples.git). These samples will help you to build the interface between products and controllers. \r\nFeel free to use and adapt them to your needs.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---------\r\nPlease read the [license file](https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3/ARSDKBuildUtils/blob/master/LICENSE.md).",
